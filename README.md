### Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with the slideshow web page, make sure that the index.html file and the images folder are stored in the same directory on your computer or web server. Also, make sure that the file names and file paths are correct and that the images are in a compatible format (such as JPEG or PNG).

If you are still experiencing issues, you can try clearing your web browser's cache and reloading the page. If the issue persists, try opening the web page in a different web browser or on a different device.
